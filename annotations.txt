    - talk about the benefits
- The Generics' power to reuse code
    - show an example 

- Conclusions
    - I want to change to Typescript with an existing code base
    - I want to write and to check in compilation time my code
    - I want to avoid unreacheable code in my team
    - I want to hit the bull's eye at the first time 
    - I want to support older Javascript versions 
    - People Say "It's just typing"
